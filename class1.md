# Class 1
## Key Skills:
- Coding is mostly about managing complexity of your code.
- Keep it *dumb*. Optimize for development (most of the time). 
- Can you accurately assess your skill when confronting a problem, and thus assess the risk you're taking in each step of the way?

## Coding Mechanics
- Takes a lot of work
- There is no shortcut
- If you cut corners here, you will pay the price
  - either you waste a lot of time in your training,
  - or you don't go as far as you deserve

1. Inspection Skills
2. Testing Skills
3. Workflow
4. Best Practices
5. Bad Habits
6. Bugs Hunting Script


## Analytical Skills
1. Drawing Skills (first on paper, then in your mind)
2. Pseudocode and algorithm design

## Analyze sample tests
What are the takeaways from each sample tests?
1. __________________________
2. __________________________
3. __________________________

## Brute force solution
You may not need it in this case but it serves as a demonstration why brute force solution can be useful.

## Coding best practices
1. Conform your code logic to problem convention (start row/column index from 1)
2. Why not *always* declare local varialbes i, j?
3. Use of constants to streamline testing
4. Always create test files for redirection
