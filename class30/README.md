## Water Jug Problem
- There are 2 water jugs with capacities N and M liters respectively.
- Initially, both of them are empty
- You can perform the following operations for infinitely many times (one operation at a time)
    1. Empty a jug
    2. Fully fill a jug
    3. Pour water from one jug to another until either one jug is empty / full
- How to get a specific volume K in one of the jugs?
- How to do that in the minimum number of steps?

### Cases to consider
|N|M|K|
|---|---|---|
|3|4|2
|10|13|6
|10|13|8
|12|37|6
|9|15|5
|59|131|49
